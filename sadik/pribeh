<p>My&nbsp;mother&nbsp;met&nbsp;my father a&nbsp;year and a&nbsp;half before&nbsp;I was born, and by&nbsp;all accounts it was a&nbsp;great love at&nbsp;first sight. Already during&nbsp;pregnancy they often argued, which&nbsp;meant stress for&nbsp;mother and inevitably also stress for&nbsp;me, the&nbsp;unborn child. Parents argued&nbsp;more and&nbsp;more and their conflict eventually escalated even&nbsp;more after&nbsp;my father attacked&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother with&nbsp;a&nbsp;knife. My parents divorced when I was one year old.</p>
<p>I remember that after&nbsp;the&nbsp;divorce I began to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;difficult period when&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother started attacking&nbsp;me. I always&nbsp;had to&nbsp;behave exactly as&nbsp;she wanted or expected, otherwise some punishment always followed. Punishments were of&nbsp;different character from&nbsp;beating different parts of&nbsp;the&nbsp;body with&nbsp;various things (carpet whipper, belt, wooden spoon,&nbsp;hand), followed by&nbsp;the&nbsp;forced leaving into&nbsp;a&nbsp;corner where I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;kneel and wait for&nbsp;the&nbsp;forgiveness of&nbsp;wrong-doing, or prohibiting activities that&nbsp;made&nbsp;me&nbsp;happy. I&nbsp;had no other choice than&nbsp;to develop internal defensive&nbsp;mechanism, according to&nbsp;which I always&nbsp;had to&nbsp;behave to&nbsp;fully satisfy the&nbsp;imagination of&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother. </p>
<p>When I was seven years old,&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother&nbsp;met a&nbsp;man, whom she subsequently&nbsp;married, and he became&nbsp;my stepfather. At&nbsp;first it seemed that I will do better, because it seemed that this&nbsp;man quite likes&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother began to&nbsp;argue with&nbsp;him&nbsp;maddeningly, so he gradually began to&nbsp;hate&nbsp;me too. During&nbsp;this period I began to&nbsp;be punished from&nbsp;both sides. Mother punished&nbsp;me physically whenever I dared to&nbsp;assert&nbsp;my opinion and I did not&nbsp;meet her expectations. My father did not use physical punishment&nbsp;much. I only remember that he tried to&nbsp;teach&nbsp;me to&nbsp;ski and whenever I did not&nbsp;meet his expectations, he beat&nbsp;me with&nbsp;a&nbsp;ski pole. The&nbsp;less&nbsp;my father used physical punishment against&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother, the&nbsp;more he cursed and used different psychological pressure on&nbsp;me. A&nbsp;frequent term of&nbsp;address of&nbsp;my person was a&nbsp;jerk. Sometimes parents probably came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;common strategy. Although I was very good at&nbsp;school one year I was forced, for&nbsp;example, to&nbsp;carry a&nbsp;special piece of&nbsp;paper, which&nbsp;my teachers always&nbsp;had to&nbsp;sign for&nbsp;me after&nbsp;school and agree that I&nbsp;had behaved perfectly. Any&nbsp;mark that was not acceptable for&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother&nbsp;meant beatings. Certain form of&nbsp;physical punishment would represent the&nbsp;efforts of&nbsp;my parents frighten&nbsp;me constantly. My father frightened&nbsp;me for&nbsp;example by&nbsp;slashing the&nbsp;trousers belt that evoked beating&nbsp;me. My&nbsp;mother also used a&nbsp;sophisticated frightening. Let&nbsp;me state here a&nbsp;few cases, because some are really&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;believe. </p>
<p>Once it&nbsp;happened to&nbsp;me that when I was playing with&nbsp;my friends I hit the&nbsp;back of&nbsp;my head, and as&nbsp;I was already confused from&nbsp;all the&nbsp;frightening I could feel at&nbsp;the&nbsp;nape of&nbsp;my neck a&nbsp;"hollow" (which is&nbsp;a normal physiological shape of&nbsp;the&nbsp;skull). My&nbsp;mother vividly portrayed that if the&nbsp;hollow did not disappear until&nbsp;the&nbsp;morning, we would&nbsp;have to&nbsp;go to&nbsp;the&nbsp;hospital, where&nbsp;my head would be inflated. The&nbsp;second example&nbsp;has something to&nbsp;do with&nbsp;my sister. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;keep an&nbsp;eye on&nbsp;her when she was a&nbsp;child. Unfortunately she fell on&nbsp;her head, she cried a&nbsp;little and then she seemed fine. However,&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother said that if something like&nbsp;that&nbsp;happens a&nbsp;child often dies of&nbsp;apneusis at&nbsp;night. I still remember holding&nbsp;my breath and watching&nbsp;my little sister all night if she was breathing or not. Another example was&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother's warning which I heard&nbsp;many times&nbsp;that I should pay attention on&nbsp;the&nbsp;toilet because it&nbsp;happened several times&nbsp;that an&nbsp;animal attacked somebody when sitting on&nbsp;the&nbsp;toilet. Perhaps you can imagine how long as&nbsp;a&nbsp;little boy I used to&nbsp;sit horrified on&nbsp;the&nbsp;toilet and waited what animal would damage&nbsp;my backside. The&nbsp;last example was the&nbsp;joint work of&nbsp;both of&nbsp;my parents, who found&nbsp;my&nbsp;member too small and thus recommended&nbsp;me a&nbsp;specific strategy to&nbsp;extend it - take your&nbsp;member between&nbsp;your&nbsp;hands and using opposing&nbsp;movements of&nbsp;the&nbsp;hands try to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;longer roll. I tried doing it for&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks but&nbsp;then I told&nbsp;myself that it is&nbsp;nonsense and stopped doing it.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;numerous prohibitions,&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;destroy&nbsp;my&nbsp;multiyear child work just because she just did not like&nbsp;my behaviour or&nbsp;my&nbsp;marks. At&nbsp;Primary School, we were three classmates interested in&nbsp;Prehistory and we competed among&nbsp;themselves who would&nbsp;have&nbsp;more&nbsp;magazine articles about&nbsp;Prehistoric animals. My two-year work,&nbsp;my two wonderful books which&nbsp;meant an&nbsp;escape from&nbsp;everyday stress for&nbsp;me were thrown away by&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I&nbsp;had worse years ahead. Although the&nbsp;relationship of&nbsp;my father and&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother was not good, they decided to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;house, which&nbsp;meant&nbsp;more arguments and&nbsp;more beatings for&nbsp;me. Unfortunately, only once I almost decided to&nbsp;go to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Police. It was the&nbsp;moment when&nbsp;my alleged not greeting the&nbsp;neighbour became the&nbsp;alleged reason for&nbsp;my punishment. My&nbsp;mother was in&nbsp;such frenzy that she beat&nbsp;me in&nbsp;the&nbsp;bath-tub so that I&nbsp;had bruises all over&nbsp;my body. At&nbsp;that&nbsp;moment I first told&nbsp;myself that something was wrong and it is&nbsp;not normal. Yet, as&nbsp;usual,&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother kept telling&nbsp;me: "Don't you dare say anything to&nbsp;anybody".</p>
<p>When I was fifteen, we&nbsp;moved into&nbsp;a&nbsp;new house, which was built next&nbsp;to&nbsp;my stepfather's parents. Although they helped us all the&nbsp;time with&nbsp;the&nbsp;construction of&nbsp;the&nbsp;house, our&nbsp;mother forbade us to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;grandparents and we were not allowed to&nbsp;even say hello. She watched us at&nbsp;every step we&nbsp;made, and if we or&nbsp;more often our father greeted them there was a&nbsp;quarrel almost every day. Although I grew up&nbsp;and&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother stopped beating&nbsp;me, it was for&nbsp;me negative environment and quarrels 365 days a&nbsp;year, and knowing that I am observed at&nbsp;every step was great stress. Due to&nbsp;the&nbsp;pressure&nbsp;my father was experiencing, he vented his anger on&nbsp;me at&nbsp;every possible opportunity. I could not eat what I wanted; I could not wash the&nbsp;dishes the&nbsp;way I wanted to, I could not even use the&nbsp;computer as&nbsp;I needed and so on. </p>
<p>My entire childhood I was standing between&nbsp;these two people while they were&nbsp;handling their own problems. My school studies represented a&nbsp;separate chapter of&nbsp;my life. Especially in&nbsp;Primary School I was frequently bullied by&nbsp;classmates. Because of&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother's obsession with&nbsp;good grades, I developed a&nbsp;careful strategy how to&nbsp;rewrite&nbsp;my&nbsp;marks in&nbsp;the&nbsp;pupil's book so that the&nbsp;physical punishment did not follow. Retrospectively, I realize that I usually came home with&nbsp;great fear and uncertainty of&nbsp;what awaits&nbsp;me at&nbsp;home again. In&nbsp;High School&nbsp;my classmates laughed at&nbsp;me because they did not understand (even I did not understand) why when they walked past&nbsp;me and just indicate the&nbsp;movement of&nbsp;the&nbsp;hand, I would hide&nbsp;my head immediately (when I was small I got so&nbsp;many slaps that that resulted even in&nbsp;these&nbsp;harmful consequences). </p>
<p>Endless days of&nbsp;fear and uncertainty took a&nbsp;heavy toll. Later, I realized that even as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child I became very sensitive to&nbsp;stress. I lost the&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;relax, I was very irritated and quality of&nbsp;my social life was very low, because I was forbidden almost everything by&nbsp;my parents, or I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;fight for&nbsp;permission of&nbsp;anything for&nbsp;very long time. </p>
<p>In&nbsp;my life I suffered from&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar fate as&nbsp;the&nbsp;majority of&nbsp;abused children. Even in&nbsp;childhood I developed a&nbsp;tendency to&nbsp;depression and anxiety. It was not until&nbsp;ten years later that I realized that it was not completely normal, though that when I was young I often imagined how&nbsp;my parents&nbsp;have an&nbsp;accident somewhere and tragically die and I would&nbsp;have to&nbsp;live without&nbsp;them. I was not able to&nbsp;relax, I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;do something all the&nbsp;time. At&nbsp;night I used to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;repeatedly with&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;breathlessness. In&nbsp;adolescence I replaced parental love with&nbsp;alcohol and then smoking&nbsp;marijuana. Only with&nbsp;the&nbsp;help of&nbsp;these could I establish social contacts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the&nbsp;worst was still about&nbsp;to come. When I became independent and finally got rid of&nbsp;the&nbsp;life in&nbsp;the&nbsp;tyrannical system,&nbsp;my anxiety and depression showed up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;extent that I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;seek the&nbsp;help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;psychologist and a&nbsp;psychiatrist. Because&nbsp;my abuse began at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very early age, I did not&nbsp;have the&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;acquire one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF CHILDREN, which is&nbsp;the right to&nbsp;the&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;tell anything at&nbsp;any time to&nbsp;a&nbsp;loved one. Therefore it took several long years before&nbsp;I&nbsp;managed with&nbsp;psychologists to&nbsp;open&nbsp;my PandoraÂ´s box completely. </p>
<p>I graduated from&nbsp;university, and I hold a&nbsp;prestigious post. People around&nbsp;me like&nbsp;me and I am considered to&nbsp;be a&nbsp;decent and good&nbsp;man. Like&nbsp;once in&nbsp;my childhood, even today, no one knows what hell on&nbsp;earth I lived through&nbsp;and how&nbsp;hard it is&nbsp;to live with&nbsp;my anxiety and depression. The&nbsp;worst thing is&nbsp;my&nbsp;haunting feeling that life around&nbsp;me is&nbsp;incredibly beautiful, but&nbsp;I internally due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;disturbed psyche can&nbsp;hardly ever feel it, especially because of&nbsp;my almost constantly lasting anxiety and panic attacks. </p>
<p>This website was created to&nbsp;inform the&nbsp;public about&nbsp;violence against&nbsp;children and what can&nbsp;happen if people are blind and oblivious to&nbsp;their surroundings. Although our family seemed to&nbsp;be working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;compact body, there still were a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;indications according to&nbsp;which you&nbsp;might&nbsp;have found out&nbsp;that I was suffering and I needed help. First it was&nbsp;my own father, who knew the&nbsp;mother, and who gave&nbsp;me up&nbsp;completely and thus did not protect&nbsp;me against&nbsp;her, knowing what&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother is&nbsp;like. During&nbsp;my school years they were the&nbsp;teachers who played a&nbsp;game with&nbsp;my parents on&nbsp;signing a&nbsp;special paper on&nbsp;the&nbsp;correctness of&nbsp;my behaviour. Also neighbours in&nbsp;the&nbsp;block of&nbsp;flats where we lived, and who&nbsp;had to&nbsp;hear&nbsp;me screaming with&nbsp;pain and then crying for&nbsp;several years. As&nbsp;well as&nbsp;some&nbsp;members of&nbsp;our family who&nbsp;had plenty of&nbsp;evidence of&nbsp;how badly the&nbsp;parents treat&nbsp;me. Some tried several times&nbsp;to stand up&nbsp;for&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;in fact nobody rescued&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>For the&nbsp;outside world our parents&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;create the&nbsp;perfect illusion of&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy home, which was based on&nbsp;the&nbsp;meeting&nbsp;material needs. Unfortunately, there were&nbsp;many people who, although did not know how&nbsp;much I suffered, knew that life in&nbsp;our family was hell, yet said incredible sentences like:</p>
<p>â€žAren't you sorry for&nbsp;the&nbsp;loss of&nbsp;property if your parents get divorced?â€œ</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>â€žGet in&nbsp;your room with&nbsp;your sister, when parents argue.â€œ</p>
<p>All this just illustrates the&nbsp;absent-mindedness of&nbsp;some people who prefer property benefits - things to&nbsp;mental values.</p>
<p>Some of&nbsp;you&nbsp;might say how deplorable acts&nbsp;my parents did to&nbsp;me, especially when due to&nbsp;them I took incurable health problems from&nbsp;childhood. But&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;add that&nbsp;my parents are themselves victims of&nbsp;genetics -&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother, or abuse -&nbsp;my father.  From&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother's side it was her grandfather, who was violent, and for&nbsp;example, he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;burn the&nbsp;house in&nbsp;which his family was present. From&nbsp;my father's side it was his stepfather, whose beating of&nbsp;his own children was widely known. Therefore, the&nbsp;parents cannot be found guilty, because they just did what they&nbsp;had seen in&nbsp;their families, or what they inherited genetically. But&nbsp;we cannot be reconciled with&nbsp;the&nbsp;parents (in&nbsp;my case with&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother) who excuse their actions with&nbsp;statements like&nbsp;"Even in&nbsp;other families they beat kids" They cannot admit what&nbsp;happened and they continue to&nbsp;revolve in&nbsp;a&nbsp;vicious circle and they destroy other people even though they would be able to&nbsp;get help from&nbsp;the&nbsp;family and&nbsp;me, as&nbsp;the&nbsp;victim of&nbsp;their educational experiment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I learned firsthand this vicious circle. I&nbsp;myself was abused for&nbsp;many years and at&nbsp;the&nbsp;first opportunity, when I&nbsp;myself could&nbsp;mistreat, I did it. At&nbsp;that time I was with&nbsp;my best friend at&nbsp;a&nbsp;children's camp. We shared a&nbsp;room and because I was stronger, I played a&nbsp;game with&nbsp;him every night. Every time he relaxed his&nbsp;hand I took it and I slammed it against&nbsp;a&nbsp;wooden wall, until&nbsp;he began to&nbsp;cry. My weaker friend became the&nbsp;only way I could release&nbsp;my accumulated anger. Of&nbsp;course I did not realize until&nbsp;much later. Fortunately, thanks to&nbsp;many circumstances, I was able to&nbsp;leave this vicious circle.</p>
<p>Thank you, if you've read to&nbsp;the&nbsp;end of&nbsp;my story, and found some advice and positive inspiration for&nbsp;your life in&nbsp;it. Do not forget that YOUR LITTLE BEINGS are THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS YOU HAVE and if they are now somewhere nearby, take them up&nbsp;in&nbsp;your arms, give them a&nbsp;hug and kiss them and tell them that they are THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIFE.</p>
<p>Please remember that the&nbsp;majority of&nbsp;child abuse&nbsp;happens in&nbsp;families that are outwardly respectable, but&nbsp;little human beings experiencing hell on&nbsp;earth suffer a&nbsp;lot.</p>
<p>PLEASE, DO NOT BE INDIFFERENT TO ANY VIOLENCE AND ESPECIALLY VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN, WHO CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES. </p>

<p class="note">This story is&nbsp;composed of&nbsp;many others that&nbsp;have found a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;me in&nbsp;the&nbsp;course of&nbsp;several years as&nbsp;individual&nbsp;mosaic pieces. Then, I put them together to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;unique story whose overall picture should serve to&nbsp;illustrate how some parents educate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tyrannical and damaging way. Knowing that&nbsp;many people I&nbsp;have&nbsp;met on&nbsp;my life journey&nbsp;have experienced a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;'My Story'&nbsp;has become the&nbsp;initial idea for&nbsp;creating the&nbsp;website. I would be grateful if you share the&nbsp;message; if you discuss the&nbsp;ideas contained in&nbsp;it; and especially, if you no longer are afraid to&nbsp;speak of&nbsp;your traumatic experiences. This is&nbsp;the only way to&nbsp;change parentsâ€™ insights into&nbsp;the&nbsp;upbringing of&nbsp;their children and, ultimately, their rescue. Thank you...</p>
